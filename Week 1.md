Week 1
=====


Learning Activities and Resources: 
---------
This week I cleared the cobwebs on using Git to commit and push repositories to github to make a start on the journal entries. I've been pushing myself to use commandline to do these types of activities, and found the following video to explain the process quite well.

 * Read through the tutorial on how to configure a publishing source for my static startup website on github. 


Estimated Hours:
---------
Spent 5 hours so far. 


Content Insights:
-------------
HTML - Markup language used for structuring and organizing the content of a web page, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, and links
CSS - Stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML elements, including aspects like layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.
Bootstrap - Opensource frontend framework that simplifies and fasttracks webdev by providing a collection of pre-designed components and utilities. 


Career / Employability / Learning Insights:
----------

Whern I first read the practical 1 notes I found myself trying to do several things at once (get started on SiteGround, re-familiarise myself with git/github, and re-familiarise myself with html / css) and unsurprisingly didn't get far. 

I then took things slower, re-read the prac, and put together the following plan. 
1. Fire up VC Code (it was already installed) and install PHPStorm, and play around with both to see which one I liked more. 
2. Re-familiarise myself with git/github
3. Make a start on my journal. 
4. Get familiar with Boot Strap
5. Start building a local 3-page startup website. 
6. Move everything to github into two seperate repositories, and get familiar with adding, updating, committing and pushing changes to the github site.
