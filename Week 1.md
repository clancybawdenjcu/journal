Week 1
=====


Learning Activities and Resources: 
---------
This week I cleared the cobwebs on using Git to commit and push repositories to github to make a start on the journal entries. I've been pushing myself to use commandline to do these types of activities, and found the following video to explain the process quite well.

Watched a youtube video explaining how to use bootstrap code via a CDN, which also discussed a bit of html / css, and how to modify code to achieve the desired outcome on the website.

Content Insights:
-------------
* HTML - Markup language used for structuring and organizing the content of a web page, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, and links
* CSS - Stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML elements, including aspects like layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.
* Bootstrap - Opensource frontend framework that simplifies and fasttracks webdev by providing a collection of pre-designed components and utilities. 


Career / Employability / Learning Insights:
----------

When I first read the practical 1 notes I found myself trying to do several things at once (get started on SiteGround, re-familiarise myself with git/github, and re-familiarise myself with html / css) and unsurprisingly didn't get far. 

I then took things slower, re-read the prac, and put together the following plan. 
1. Fire up VC Code (it was already installed) and install PHPStorm, and play around with both to see which one I liked more. 
2. Re-familiarise myself with git/github
3. Make a start on my journal. 
4. Get familiar with Boot Strap
5. Start building a local 3-page startup website. 
6. Move everything to github into two seperate repositories, and get familiar with adding, updating, committing and pushing changes to the github site. 
7. Complete journal entry and startup website by working on the code locally on my PC's VS Code program, and push commits to github. 

In the Friday lecture Lindsay mentioned watching learning videos in 1.5 or greater speed. This is the best piece of advice I've received in a long while. Being able to get through content 1.5 - 2 times quicker all the while not finding myself drifting off because I'm paying more attention has allowed me to get through content much quicker. 

I'm not sure if you're aware, but clancy.bawden+literallyanything@my.jcu.edu.au (as the name implies, it can be anything) redirects to clancy.bawden@my.jcu.edu.au on JCU's exchange server. This is great when you have to provide your email address to services likely to spam you (move all emails to clancy.bawden+signups@my.jcu.edu.au -> trash), but has the added benefit of creating any number of unique addresses to cash in on one-time offers.
