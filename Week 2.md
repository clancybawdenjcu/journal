Career / Employability / Learning Insights:
----------

As per first year: Don't lose sight of the goal of the website you're building. Keep asking yourself - what is the goal!

CMS's like Joomla certainly make website building and content updating possible for people that don't have an IT background, but it's obvious there are different levels of proficiency when using CMS's. A seasoned web developer will be able to create a more usable site with a more clearly defined goal with the same set of tools due to their increased awareness of User Experience and website design conventions.
